<p class="speech Proteus">What?</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech Valentine">To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech Proteus">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>
