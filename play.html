<h5>Verona.An open place</h5>
    SCENE I. Verona. An open place.
    Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
    <h6>VALENTINE</h6>
    <p>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
    Were't not affection chains thy tender days
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    I rather would entreat thy company
    To see the wonders of the world abroad,
    Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
    But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
    Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>
    <h6>PROTEUS</h6>
    <p>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
    Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
    Wish me partaker in thy happiness
    When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
    If ever danger do environ thee,
    Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
    For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</p>
    <h6>VALENTINE</h6>
    <p>And on a love-book pray for my success?</p>
    <h6>PROTEUS</h6>
    <p>Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</p>
    <h6>VALENTINE</h6>
    <p>That's on some shallow story of deep love:
    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</p>
    <h6>PROTEUS</h6>
    <p>That's a deep story of a deeper love:
    For he was more than over shoes in love.<p>
    <h6>VALENTINE</h6>
    <p>'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
    And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</p>
    <h6>PROTEUS</h6>
    <p>Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</p>
    <h6>VALENTINE</h6>
    <p>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>
