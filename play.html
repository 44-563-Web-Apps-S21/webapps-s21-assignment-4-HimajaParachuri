<h3>SCENE I. Verona. An open place.
    Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
    VALENTINE
    Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
    Were't not affection chains thy tender days
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    I rather would entreat thy company
    To see the wonders of the world abroad,
    Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
    But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
    Even as I would when I to love begin.
    PROTEUS
    Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
    Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
    Wish me partaker in thy happiness
    When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
    If ever danger do environ thee,
    Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
    For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
    VALENTINE
    And on a love-book pray for my success?
    PROTEUS
    Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
    VALENTINE
    That's on some shallow story of deep love:
    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
    PROTEUS
    That's a deep story of a deeper love:
    For he was more than over shoes in love.
    VALENTINE
    'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
    And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
    PROTEUS
    Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
    VALENTINE
    No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</h3>
